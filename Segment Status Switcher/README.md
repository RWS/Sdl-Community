# Segment Status Switcher Plugin


When you are working in the Editor View in Studio the Segment Status Switcher provides a way to change the status of a segment in one click, or through the use of a keyboard shortcut.
Studio requires a more convoluted method to achieve this and takes at least three clicks of the mouse.

Notes:
The switcher will not work with multiple segments (limitation of the API)
If the segment has no target content the switcher appears not to work. It does, but will only show the result when you move out of the segment (limitation of the API)
