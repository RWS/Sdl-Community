            <para>Represents a code page in the sense of a <see cref="T:System.Text.Encoding"/>
            object, using a mechanism that allows basic manipulations on a system where 
            support for the code page may not be installed.</para>
            
            <para>Normally the Codepage object is constructed from an Encoding object,
            but for persistence it can be constructed from a string.</para>
            
            <para>If the code page is supported by the local machine you can use the
            <see cref="P:Sdl.Core.Globalization.Codepage.Encoding"/> property to retrieve the corresponding 
            .NET encoding object. If you access this property for a code page
            that is not supported on this machine this will result in a 
            <see cref="T:Sdl.Core.Globalization.UnsupportedCodepageException"/>.</para>
            
            <para>Using this mechanism as opposed to directly using the Encoding class
            means that we can still work with files for which a code page is not
            supported on a certain machine (at least as long as no code page conversion
            operations are needed). This may be a common use case when a file
            is converted on one system and then edited on another.</para>

            Since the code page name could represent a code page that is not supported
            on this particular system there is no safe way we can determine if the name
            is a valid encoding name or not. Thus anything else than null or an empty
            string for a name must be considered a "valid" code page name.
            To test if a codepage is supported on this system, use the <see cref="P:Sdl.Core.Globalization.Codepage.IsSupported"/> property.

            <para>Represents a language in the sense of a <see cref="T:System.Globalization.CultureInfo"/>
            object, using a mechanism that allows basic manipulations on a system where the language
            is not fully supported.</para>
            
            <para>The reason we use this type as opposed to the <c>CultureInfo</c> class
            in the .NET Framework is that when working with files we may convert
            the file on a system that supports a particular language (i.e. the <c>CultureInfo</c>
            for this language abbreviation is known), but the file may subsequently
            be opened on a system that does not yet have support for this language.</para>
            
            <para>Depending on what processing is to be done this may be a perfectly
            valid use case, and it would be too harsh a restriction to require support
            for the language to be installed on all systems that may ever look at the file.</para>
            
            <para>Under normal circumstances the language should be created from a <c>CultureInfo</c> object.</para>
            
            <para>In addition this wrapper allows a language to be represented by a plain string
            when no <c>CultureInfo</c> for this language is supported on the system, and thus
            allows the language to be represented until some truly language specific 
            processing is needed (i.e. when the corresponding <c>CultureInfo</c> is required).</para>
            
            <para>When supported by the operating system the corresponding <c>CultureInfo</c> can be obtained 
            directly from the <see cref="P:Sdl.Core.Globalization.Language.CultureInfo"/> property. If not supported this will throw an
