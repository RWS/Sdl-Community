# projectTermExtract

This plugin adds a very neat feature to Studio allowing you to extract term candidates from your Project, or specific files within a project.  
The plugin works by adding a file containing the terms to Studio for translation, and then converts the file to a termbase and adds it to your project.

The plugin also provides for some simple refining of the extraction using a very simple and visual interface that makes the process of term extraction incredibly simple, and enjoyable to work with
