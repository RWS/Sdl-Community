# Toolkit

Slice, change or clear SDLXLIFF files individually, within a project or a whole folder. 

Create a ‘view’ of your files/projects by generating a new SDLXLIFF containing only the segments you want.

Clear the segments or change the status of or lock/unlock segments in your file/projects based on a number of specific criteria including translation status, match value, document structure and translation origin.
Clear the segments of all the translations in your file/project based on specific criteria.
Search and replace text in source or target across files/project using text or regex.
Copy source to target for any selection criteria.
