Antidote, from Druide informatique, is an advanced collection of language tools for French and English, including a spelling and grammar checking tool that integrates with MSWord and a variety of other applications. This free plugin adds the Antidote toolbar you'll find in MSWord into Studio under the review ribbon so you can work with this application interactively as you translate or review. The plugin is free, but if you wish to use this you must have a copy of Antidote installed otherwise nothing is going to happen!
For more details on how the plugin works with Studio refer to this article : http://multifarious.filkin.com/2016/09/07/antidote/ For more details about Antidote refer to this website: http://www.antidote.info/
