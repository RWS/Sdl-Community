It will remove them from Studio, so if you delete this file and need to put some or all of the projects back, you will have to add the projects back one at a time by using the Open Project command in Studio.  The projects.xml contains the following information:" +
				"\n - details of the Batch Tasks available to you. If you have custom Batch Tasks then these will be lost and you'll have to recreate them. " +
				"\n - details of all the projects in your Projects View.  Not the projects themselves, only metadata telling Studio what their names are and where to find them." +

This automatic backup file is not the same as the one you can export and if this is the source of your problem it is better to manually export these dictionaries from Studio and keep them somewhere safe so they are easy to restore." +

These are used to recreate the default keyboard shortcuts in your profiles you use if you delete the UserSettings.xml.  None of your customisations are held in these files and they are replaced by the defaults in the Studio program folder if you delete them." +

So things like customised keyboard shortcuts, window locations, choice of colour scheme, whether or not you agreed to share data (error information for example), Translation Memory lists, your preferences in File -> Options, units used for your confirmation statistics, recently used folders for Projects, Translation memories, Files, Termbases etc.  This isn't a comprehensive list but hopefully illustrates how much of your personalised settings are held in this one file.  So deleting it is going to mean you spending time setting them all up again.  Most of the things in this file cannot be exported through the User Interface in Studio so starting again will be a manual process." +

Credentials for logging in are not held here as they are encrypted elsewhere in the software. Deleting this file means you are going to lose all the connections you had and they need to be added again. " +
